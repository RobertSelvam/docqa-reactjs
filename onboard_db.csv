Based on the client business need conversion team will finalize the files.

For Inbound files - 
Application Development or Onboarding team allocates file and application development sets up JCL to process file. 
For TIF or TIFI files - 
Files will need to be allocated and TIF panel will need to be updated to make the file required once sending system is sending the file.
Sample Inbound Files - 
1. House Price TIF File if the client chooses to override prices. 
Note: House prices will take precedence over vendor pricing. Manual price updates through MREQ are considered house prices. ","Clients can send in their own house pricing file which can be used to price securities.  Typically these files are named:
TIF.C***.INPHP** (*** = client number and ** after INPHP can be number of file).  An example of this naming convention is TIF.C***.INPHPR1.  This should be made required in the nightly bookkeeping stream batch and the name can only be 17 bytes maximum.
It is also advisable to get permission from MSD Product or ICE on sending any outbound MSD related files to a client or a client's vendor.  Broadridge is contractually obligated to stay within the confines of our contract with ICE on how the ICE information is distributed to our clients.
There are no predefind MSD file that are automatically sent to clients.  Each file is done on a one off basis.
If client is planning to send House Price file, then account number to be used should be lowest in the customer range in B1 card 009120.",MSD Product/Dev team/Conversions,MSD-Product <MSD-Product@broadridge.com>,,,,
